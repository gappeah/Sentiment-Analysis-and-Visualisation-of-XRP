# Sentiment Analysis and Visualisation of Stock News

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a powerful tool for performing sentiment analysis on stock market-related news and social media data, followed by visualizing the results to gain insights into market trends. The analysis will involve extracting sentiment from various text sources, correlating these sentiments with stock price movements, and providing interactive visualizations to present the findings.

Creating a sentiment analysis model for XRP is a great idea, especially given the dynamic and sentiment-driven nature of the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a customized approach for XRP:

1. Define the Objective

*	Target Asset: XRP (Ripple).
*	Goal: For example:
*	Predicting XRP price movement based on sentiment.
*	Identifying positive, negative, or neutral sentiment in discussions about XRP.

2. Collect XRP-Specific Data

a. Data Sources

*	Social Media:
*	Twitter: Use hashtags like #XRP, #Ripple.
*	Reddit: Subreddits like r/Ripple, r/cryptocurrency.
*	Telegram/Discord Channels: Crypto-specific groups.
*	Crypto News Outlets:
*	CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, Decrypt.
*	XRP-specific blogs or community updates.
*	Official Communications:
*	Press releases or updates from Ripple Labs.
*	Market Data:
*	Historical XRP price, volume, and volatility data from exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc.

b. Sentiment Labels

* Manually label a subset of tweets, articles, and posts.
*	Use market events as proxies:
*	Positive sentiment: Large price increases after positive news.
*	Negative sentiment: Price drops or regulatory challenges.

3. Preprocess XRP Data

a. Clean Text Data

*	Remove URLs, hashtags, and cryptocurrency tickers.
*	Normalize mentions of XRP and Ripple.

b. Tokenize and Contextualize

*	Focus on cryptocurrency-specific terms:
*	Positive: “partnership,” “bullish,” “adoption.”
*	Negative: “lawsuit,” “dump,” “FUD.”

c. Address Multilinguality (if needed)

*	Translate non-English discussions using tools like Google Translate or APIs.

d. Combine with Market Data

*	Merge sentiment with XRP price trends, volume changes, or volatility indices.

4. Model Building

a. Sentiment Lexicon for Cryptocurrencies

*	Extend traditional sentiment lexicons (e.g., VADER, Loughran-McDonald) with crypto-specific terms.
*	Alternatively, create a custom lexicon based on your labeled data.

b. Machine Learning or Deep Learning Models

*	Baseline: Logistic Regression or Random Forest using features like word counts or TF-IDF.
*	Advanced: Fine-tune a transformer like BERT or use CryptoBERT or FinBERT to handle crypto-specific language.

c. Multi-Modal Inputs

*	Combine text sentiment with numerical features (e.g., price trends) using multi-input models.

5. Evaluate and Backtest

*	Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
*	Use historical XRP price data to backtest sentiment predictions for predictive power.

6. Deployment

*	Deploy as a dashboard or API.
*	Automate continuous data ingestion from Twitter, news APIs, or crypto forums for real-time analysis.
